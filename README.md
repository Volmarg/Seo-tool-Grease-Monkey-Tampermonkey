Once installed, You can run/close script on web pages with combination of keys „SHIFT+X”.

This tool is used for SEO website analyse. It shows elements like headers, links, title attributes, alt attributes, etc.

Source code of this tool is faaaar away from being good. First of all it was one of my first scripts (was learning JS), second that some JS functions/solutions didnt worked well so it needed to be changed.

Tool is not perfect, sometimes won’t load or close – I know that, but I’m not working on this tool anymore.
